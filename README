== What is this? ==

This is a Java Library written to simplify download and upload from multiple
free share sites.

Instead of writing an specific API for each situation, I designed a single API
capable of almost everything! Upload and downloads are done through Java.NIO
Channels and with those you can stream the file, both up and down.

Also, if you wish, you can easily (with less than 10 lines!) implement an
file copier. It downloads the file from one server and transfer it to another!

== Can I use it already? ==
The API is basically done, but so far not much servers are supported, but you
are, however, free to use it already! By the way, once you start using it, if
you develop any new service, please share with me!
